# Hotel Churn Prediction: A Machine Learning Operations Project

This is a project developed for the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) course of the Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at NOVA IMS. Its aim was to simulate a real-world process of deploying a machine learning model (the final score was not the primary concern, but its deployment). The data folder is in a zip folder because of size concerns.

## Key Project Components
1. Project Planning in Sprints;
2. Data Exploration ([in the notebook folder](https://github.com/adriana-monteiro/mlops-churn/tree/main/notebooks));
3. Kedro Framework:
   * Data Unit Testing;
   * MLflow experimentation and model versioning;
   * Data drift evaluation.
